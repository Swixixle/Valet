# Perimeter Walker Tone Self-Check

Before finalizing the script, verify:

1. Is the language tracing consequence, not issuing judgment?
2. Does it feel like inevitability, not alarm?
3. Is the pace measured — never rushed, never panicked?
4. Is the uncertainty acknowledged without being dwelt upon?
5. Does it end at the edge of consequence, not beyond it?
